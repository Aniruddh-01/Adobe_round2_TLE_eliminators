Overview
This repository contains code for solving various computer vision tasks using OpenCV and Python. The tasks include:
Open Curve: Reading CSV files, plotting polylines, and visualizing Bezier curves.
Isolated Shapes: Identifying and drawing shapes (lines, rectangles, circles, polygons) in an image using edge detection and RANSAC.
Disconnected Shapes: Identifying and drawing shapes (lines, rectangles, circles, polygons) in an image using edge detection and RANSAC, with additional processing to handle disconnected shapes.
