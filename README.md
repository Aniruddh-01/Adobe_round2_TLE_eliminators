## Overview

This repository contains code for solving various computer vision tasks using OpenCV and Python. The tasks include:

- **Open Curve:** Reading CSV files, plotting polylines, and visualizing Bezier curves.
- **Isolated Shapes:** Identifying and drawing shapes (lines, rectangles, circles, polygons) in an image using edge detection and RANSAC.
- **Disconnected Shapes:** Identifying and drawing shapes (lines, rectangles, circles, polygons) in an image using edge detection and RANSAC, with additional processing to handle disconnected shapes.

## Requirements

To get started, you'll need the following:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV 4.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
